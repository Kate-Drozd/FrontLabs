<!--
you must name your div's accordingly
the first scrollwindow object defined will have div's named 'ScrollWindow0'
and obviously the index number on the end goes up each time you define a scroll/scrollwindow
if you're confused read the lesson on the ScrollWindow

Also - do not forget ending </p> tags, if you don't have them they can mess up layout in Netscape
